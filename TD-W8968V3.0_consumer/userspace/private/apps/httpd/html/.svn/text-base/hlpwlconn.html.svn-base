    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Verify that the Wireless configurations
          from your computer and your DSL Modem Router are matched and corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Turn off the DSL Modem Router, wait 10 seconds and turn it back ON. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>With the router on, press the reset button on the DSL Modem Router
          for at least five seconds and release it. This resets the DSL Modem Router
          to its default settings. Wait for the DSL Modem Router to initialize,
          then close and restart your Web browser. To reconfigure the router, type
          your DSL Account username and password.</p>
